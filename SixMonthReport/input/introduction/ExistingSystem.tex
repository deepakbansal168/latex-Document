\section{The Existing System}
The only System exiting to solve above problem is Thingiverse's Customizer which allows you to design parametric objects that can be customized with an easy web interface. They currently support OpenSCAD designs. Just upload your OpenSCAD script to Thingiverse and then anyone can open it in Customizer and customize it. Also, if you tag your Thing with the "customizer" tag, then your Thing page will automatically display an Open In Customizer button as a shortcut. 

But there syntax is little messy as they use comments to generate customizer which also limits the useablitiy of the customizer. \\
