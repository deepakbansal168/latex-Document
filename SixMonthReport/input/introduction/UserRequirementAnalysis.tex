\section{User Requirement Analysis} 
User Requirements Analysis for a software system is a complete description of a the requirements of the User. It include functional Requirements
and Non-functional Requirements. Non-functional requirements are 
requirements which impose constraints on the design or implementation.

 
{\bf Users of the System:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Modeller: Modeller's are the people how code to create model their for their own use or for comercial use.
		\item Client: These are the people which will customzie model to their need made by modellers before ordering or printing model themselves. 
		\item Other Softwares: Many web Apps or other software using OpenSCAD as there Backend might need to interact with customizer.
		 		
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Syntax to generate widget to modify parameter}: This means there should be a syntax which could be used to generate different widget for different type of pararmeters.
	The widgets that we entend to support are: 
	\begin{enumerate} 
		\item Spinbox:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item With Increment Size
				\item without Increment Size 
			\end{enumerate} 
		\item Checkbox 
		\item Slider
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item with Increment Size
				\item With Default Increment Size
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Textbox
		\item Special vector 
		\item Combo Box
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Simple
				\item Labeled 
			\end{enumerate}
	
	\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c|c| }
			\hline
			& \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Type of Widgets} \\
			\hline
			Type of Data&	Number&	String&	BOOL &Vector &Range	 \\ [0.5ex]

			Checkbox&	-&	-&	Y&	-&	- \\ [1ex]
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Table to show the required support of widgets for different DataType}
		\label{table2}
	\end{table}
	
	\end{enumerate}
	\item {\bf Syntax to Describe parameter}: 
		This means there should be a syntax which could be used to provide description for the parameter.
	\item \textbf{Syntax to Group Parameter}:
		This means there should be a syntax which could be used to group the parameters into different groups or tab to easily manage Customizer and make customizer interface little simple.
	\item \textbf{Syntax to Hide parameters}
		This means there should be a syntax which could be used to Hide certain parameters.
	\item \textbf{Syntax to make certain parameters Global}
		This means there should be a syntax which could be used to make certain parameters gloabal i.e. they are present in each and every group.
	\item \textbf{Save the set of parameters in JSON file}:
	This feature means there should be a way a way that give user the ability to save the value of the parameter and also we can apply them through the cmd-line and get the output.
	
	\item \textbf{Provide GUI to add Set of Parameters}
		This means there should be a way to store different set of parameters which represent different models from generic model.
	\end{itemize}
\subsection{Non functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate} 
	\item Extensible: It should be able to supports future functional requirements
	\item Usability: Simple user interfaces that a layman can understand.
	\item Modular Structure: The software should have  structure. So, that differenet parts of software would be changed without effecting other parts.
 
\end{enumerate}
