\section{MySQL}
MySQL is a fast, easy-to-use RDBMS being used for many small and big businesses. MySQL is developed,
marketed, and supported by MySQL AB, which is a Swedish company. MySQL is becoming so popular because
of many good reasons.MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by .Oracle Corporation. For proprietary use, several paid editions are available, and offer additional functionality.
MySQL is a popular choice of database for use in web applications, and is a central component of the widely used LAMP open-source web application software stack (and other "AMP" stacks). LAMP is an acronym for "Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python". Free-software open-source projects that require a full-featured database management system often use MySQL.
MySQL is the world's most popular open source database. With its proven performance, reliability and ease-of-use, MySQL has become the leading database choice for web-based applications, used by high profile web properties including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Yahoo! and many more.

Oracle drives MySQL innovation, delivering new capabilities to power next generation web, cloud, mobile and embedded applications.
\subsection{Overview}
MySQL is written in C and C++. Its SQL parser is written in yacc, but it uses a home-brewed lexical analyzer.MySQL works on many system platforms, including AIX, BSDi, FreeBSD, HP-UX, eComStation, i5/OS, IRIX, Linux, OS X, Microsoft Windows, NetBSD, Novell NetWare, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, OS/2 Warp, QNX, Oracle Solaris, Symbian, SunOS, SCO OpenServer, SCO UnixWare, Sanos and Tru64. A port of MySQL to OpenVMS also exists.
MySQL has received positive reviews, and reviewers noticed it "performs extremely well in the average case". and that the "developer interfaces are there, and the documentation (not to mention feedback in the real world via Web sites and the like) is very, very good".It has also been tested to be a "fast, stable and true multi-user, multi-threaded sql database server".
\subsection{Versions}
Notable milestones in MySQL development include:
 Original development of MySQL by Michael Widenius and David Axmark beginning in 1994
\begin{itemize}
\item First internal release on 23 May 1995
\item Version 3.19: End of 1996, from www.tcx.se
\item Version 3.20: January 1997
\item Windows version was released on 8 January 1998 for Windows 95 and NT
\item Version 3.21: production release 1998, from www.mysql.com
\item Version 3.22: alpha, beta from 1998

\item Version 5.0: beta from March 2005, production release October 2005 (cursors, stored procedures, triggers, views, XA transactions)
\item MySQL Server 6.0.11-alpha was announced[44] on 22 May 2009
\item The general availability of MySQL 5.7 was announced in October 2015.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Features}
MySQL is offered under two different editions: the open source MySQL Community Server and the proprietary Enterprise Server.MySQL Enterprise Server is differentiated by a series of proprietary extensions which install as server plugins, but otherwise shares the version numbering system and is built from the same code base.
\begin{itemize}
\item MySQL is released under an open-source license. So you have nothing to pay to use it.
\item MySQL is a very powerful program in its own right. It handles a large subset of the functionality of the most
expensive and powerful database packages.
\item MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language.
\item MySQL works on many operating systems and with many languages including PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA,
etc.
\item MySQL works very quickly and works well even with large data sets.
\item MySQL is very friendly to PHP, the most appreciated language for web development.
\item MySQL supports large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table. The default file size limit for a
table is 4GB, but you can increase this (if your operating system can handle it) to a theoretical limit of 8
million terabytes (TB).
\item MySQL is customizable. The open-source GPL license allows programmers to modify the MySQL software to
fit their own specific environments.
\item Cross-platform support
\item Stored procedures, using a procedural language that closely adheres to SQL/PSM
\item Triggers
\item Cursors
\item Updatable views
\item Online DDL when using the InnoDB Storage Engine.
\item Information schema.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Limitations}
Like other SQL databases, MySQL does not comply with the full SQL standard for some of the implemented functionality, including foreign key references when using some storage engines other than the default of InnoDB,and check constraints.

Up until MySQL 5.7, triggers are limited to one per action / timing, meaning that at most one trigger can be defined to be executed after an INSERT operation, and one before INSERT on the same table.No triggers can be defined on views.
\subsection{Backup Software}
Backup software are computer programs used to perform backup; they create supplementary exact copies of files, databases or entire computers. These programs may later use the supplementary copies to restore the original contents in the event of data loss.

Filesystem snapshot or volume manager snapshot backups are performed by using an external tool provided by the operating system (such as Logical Volume Manager in Linux) or storage device, with additional support from MySQL for ensuring consistency of such snapshots.

mysqldump is a logical backup tool included with both community and enterprise editions of MySQL. It supports backing up from all storage engines. MySQL Enterprise Backup is a hot backup utility included as part of the MySQL Enterprise subscription from Oracle, offering native InnoDB hot backup, as well as backup for other storage engines. XtraBackup is an open-source MySQL hot backup software program. Some notable features include hot, non-locking backups for InnoDB storage, incremental backups, streaming, parallel-compressed backups, throttling based on the number of I/O operations per second, etc.
\subsubsection{Virtual machiene image}
In this implementation, cloud users can upload a machine image of their own with MySQL installed, or use a ready-made machine image with an optimized installation of MySQL on it, such as the one provided by Amazon EC2.
\subsubsection{MySQL as a service}
Some cloud platforms offer MySQL "as a service". In this configuration, application owners do not have to install and maintain the MySQL database on their own. Instead, the database service provider takes responsibility for installing and maintaining the database, and application owners pay according to their usage.[89] Notable cloud-based MySQL services are the Amazon Relational Database Service; Rackspace; HP Converged Cloud; Heroku and Jelastic.
\subsubsection{Managed MySQL cloud hosting}
In this implementation, the database is not offered as a service, but the cloud provider hosts the database and manages it on the application owner's behalf. As of 2011, of the major cloud providers, only Terremark and Rackspace offer managed hosting for MySQL databases.
\subsection{MySQL workbench}
MySQL Workbench is the official integrated environment for MySQL. It was developed by MySQL AB, and enables users to graphically administer MySQL databases and visually design database structures. MySQL Workbench replaces the previous package of software, MySQL GUI Tools. Similar to other third-party packages, but still considered the authoritative MySQL front end, MySQL Workbench lets users manage database design and modeling, SQL development (replacing MySQL Query Browser) and Database administration (replacing MySQL Administrator).
MySQL Workbench is available in two editions, the regular free and open source Community Edition which may be downloaded from the MySQL website, and the proprietary Standard Edition which extends and improves the feature set of the Community Edition.
\subsubsection{Adminer}
Adminer (formerly known as phpMinAdmin) is a free MySQL front end for managing content in MySQL databases (since version 2, it also works on PostgreSQL, MS SQL, SQLite and Oracle SQL databases). Adminer is distributed under the Apache license (or GPL v2) in the form of a single PHP file (around 300 KiB in size), and is capable of managing multiple databases, with many CSS skins available. Its author is Jakub Vrána who started to develop this tool as a light-weight alternative to phpMyAdmin, in July 2007.
\subsubsection{phpMyAdmin}
phpMyAdmin is a free and open source tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of MySQL with the use of a web browser. It can perform various tasks such as creating, modifying or deleting databases, tables, fields or rows; executing SQL statements; or managing users and permissions. The software, which is available in 78 languages,is maintained by The phpMyAdmin Project.
It can import data from CSV and SQL, and transform stored data into any format using a set of predefined functions, like displaying BLOB-data as images or download-links. 
\subsubsection{Webmin}
Webmin is a web-based system configuration tool for Unix-like systems, although recent versions can also be installed and run on Windows. With it, it is possible to configure operating system internals, such as users, disk quotas, services or configuration files, as well as modify and control open source apps, such as the Apache HTTP Server, PHP or MySQL.
Webmin is largely based on Perl, running as its own process and web server. It defaults to TCP port 10000 for communicating, and can be configured to use SSL if OpenSSL is installed with additional required Perl Modules.
It is built around modules, which have an interface to the configuration files and the Webmin server. This makes it easy to add new functionality. Due to Webmin's modular design, it is possible for anyone who is interested to write plugins for desktop configuration.
Webmin also allows for controlling many machines through a single interface, or seamless login on other webmin hosts on the same subnet or LAN.

\section{IBM DB2}
DB2 is a database product from IBM. It is a Relational Database Management System 
(RDBMS). DB2 is designed to store, analyze and retrieve the data efficiently. DB2 
product is extended with the support of Object-Oriented features and non-relational 
structures with XML. 
\subsection{History}
Initially, IBM had developed DB2 product for their specific platform. Since year 1990, 
it decided to develop a Universal Database (UDB) DB2 Server, which can run on any 
authoritative operating systems such as Linux, UNIX, and Windows. 
\subsection{Versions}
For IBM DB2, the UDB current version is 10.5 with the features of BLU Acceleration 
and its code name as 'Kepler'. All the versions of DB2 till today are listed below:
\begin{itemize}  
\item 	Version Code 	Name 
\item	3.4 		Cobweb 
\item	8.1, 8.2 	Stinger 
\item	9.1 		Viper 
\item	9.5 		Viper 2 
\item	9.7 		Cobra 
\item	9.8 		It added features with Only PureScale 
\item	10.1 		Galileo 
\item   10.5 		Kepler
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Role Of DB2 In The Information On Demand World}
IBM’s direction or strategy is based on some key concepts and technologies: 
\begin{itemize}
\item On-Demand Business 
\item Information On Demand (IOD) 
\item Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)   
\item Web Services 
\item XML
\end{itemize}      
\subsection{Installation of DB2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Installation Methods by Operating Systems 
\item Installation Method 				Windows 	Linux and UNIX 
\item DB2 Setup Wizard 					Yes 		Yes 
\item Silent install 					Yes 		Yes 
\item db2 install script 				No 		Yes 
\item Manual intalation of DB2 payload files 		No 		Yes
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Hardware Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Processor : Minimum Core 2Duo
\item Ram : 1GB minimum
\item Hard disk : 30GB minimum
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Software Requirements}
Before installing the DB2 server, your system needs to get ready with the required 
software on it. For Linux, you need to install “libstdc++6.0”. 
\subsubsection{Checking System Compatability}
Before installing DB2 Server, you need to verify if your system is compatible with the 
DB2 server. For confirming the compatibility, you need to call 'db2prereqcheck' 
command on command console.
\subsection{Using the DB2 Tools}
Figure  shows most of the DB2 tools available from the IBM DB2 menu on the Windows 
platform and the sequence of items to click to start them. These same tools (except the Com- 
mand Window and a few others) are available on the Linux and UNIX platforms. 
The tools that you see in Figure 4.1 are of two types: command driven and non-command driven. 
In the next section you will learn about command-driven tools, and in Section 4.4, General 
Administration Tools, you will be presented with the non-command-driven tools, which are 
available only using a graphical interface. In most cases you can perform the same DB2 com- 
mands, SQL statements, and XQuery statements using either type of tools.
\subsubsection{The command Line Tools}
All DB2 operations are invoked by DB2 commands, SQL statements, or XQuery statements. For 
example, to back up a database, you use the BACKUP DATABASE command. To create a table, 
you use the CREATE TABLE SQL statement. To parse an XML document you use the FLWOR 
expression. All of these commands, SQL statements, and XQuery statements can be entered 
using the command-line tools. 
The command-line tools consist of the Command Line Processor (CLP), the Command Window 
(Windows platform only), and the Command Editor. Since they are command driven, you must 
have some knowledge of DB2 commands and SQL statements to use them.
\subsubsection{Web-Based Tools}
Web-based tools are not part of the IBM Menu shown in Figure 4.1; however we feel it’s impor- 
tant to mention these tools here. The main Web-based tool is the Data Server Administration 
Console (DSAC). 
%\subsubsubsection{The Data Server Administration Console} 
The Data Server Administration Console (DSAC) is a Web-based tool created using numerous 
open standards, and Web 2.0 technologies such as AJAX. It is a free product for most of its fea- 
tures and downloadable from the Internet. At the time this book was written, there were plans to 
bundle it with DB2. The DSAC has a smaller disk and memory footprint than previous DB2 
tools. You can perform about eighty percent of your administrative tasks using the DSAC. You 
can use it to manage one DB2 data server, or hundreds of IBM data servers from different plat- 
forms such as DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows, DB2 for z/OS and IDS. It is fast, simple but 
powerful, and is task-based. The DSAC has the ability to provide real time and exception-based 
monitoring, and you can drill down to determine a specific problem. Upgrades to the DSAC are 
independent of the DB2 server or clients, and this tool.
The console includes “for-free” and “for-fee” admininstration tooling. The “for-fee” features are 
grayed out until a license is purchased, and it is applied. Everything from the DSAC is scriptable.
\subsubsection{Monitoring Tools}
As a database administrator, it is important to have a good understanding of your database envi- 
ronment. Some of the things you need to know are the kinds of activities that are happening on 
the system, the database workload, and memory usage. The Monitoring tools watch the data- 
base based on the criteria you provide and generate reports. 
The graphical Monitoring tools consist of the Activity Monitor, Event Analyzer, Health Center, 
Indoubt Transaction manager, and the Memory Visualizer. 
%\subsubsubsection{Activity monitor}
The Activity Monitor helps you monitor the performance of your application and database by 
tracking monitor data. Among other things, it can help you monitor application concurrency, 
resource consumption, SQL statement usage, and lock-waiting situations. 
You can start the Activity Monitor either from the DB2 menu or using the db2am command. 
When you start the Activity Monitor, the Set Up Activity Monitor Wizard appears. This wizard 
prompts you to select from a set of predefined monitoring tasks, as shown in Figure 4.34.The data that is monitored depends on the monitoring task you select, which can be either pre- 
defined by DB2 or user defined. After setting up your Activity Monitor, you can produce a 
report. The report shows the results of the selected monitoring task. 
Figure 4.35 shows a sample report produced by the Activity Monitor, based on the selected mon- 
itoring task Tuning the dynamic SQL statement cache. In Figure 4.35, each executed dynamic 
SQL statement is listed in the left-most column. The other columns display the system resources 
that have been consumed. Click on the Details and Recommendations tab to get more informa- 
tion on the selected report. 



\section{Microsoft SQL Server}
Microsoft SQL Server 2014 is the next generation of Microsoft’s information plat-
form, with new features that deliver faster performance, expand capabilities in the
cloud, and provide powerful business insights. In this book, we explain how SQL Server
2014 incorporates in-memory technology to boost performance in online transac-
tional processing (OLTP) and data-warehouse solutions. We also describe how it eases
the transition from on-premises solutions to the cloud with added support for hybrid
environments. SQL Server 2014 continues to include components that support analysis,
although no major new features for business intelligence were included in this release.
However, several advances of note have been made in related technologies such as
Microsoft Excel 2013, Power BI for Office 365, HDInsight, and PolyBase.
\subsection{History}
In 1988 Microsoft joined Ashton-Tate and Sybase to create a variant of Sybase SQL Server for IBM OS/2 (then developed jointly with Microsoft), which was released the following year.[5] This was the first version of Microsoft SQL Server, and served as Microsoft's entry to the enterprise-level database market, competing against Oracle, IBM, and later, Sybase. SQL Server 4.2 was shipped in 1992, bundled with OS/2 version 1.3, followed by version 4.21 for Windows NT, released alongside Windows NT 3.1. SQL Server 6.0 was the first version designed for NT, and did not include any direction from Sybase.

About the time Windows NT was released in July 1993, Sybase and Microsoft parted ways and each pursued its own design and marketing schemes. Microsoft negotiated exclusive rights to all versions of SQL Server written for Microsoft operating systems. (In 1996 Sybase changed the name of its product to Adaptive Server Enterprise to avoid confusion with Microsoft SQL Server.) Until 1994, Microsoft's SQL Server carried three Sybase copyright notices as an indication of its origin.

SQL Server 7.0 and SQL Server 2000 included modifications and extensions to the Sybase code base, adding support for the IA-64 architecture. By SQL Server 2005 the legacy Sybase code had been completely rewritten.
\subsection{Architecture}
The protocol layer implements the external interface to SQL Server. All operations that can be invoked on SQL Server are communicated to it via a Microsoft-defined format, called Tabular Data Stream (TDS). TDS is an application layer protocol, used to transfer data between a database server and a client. Initially designed and developed by Sybase Inc. for their Sybase SQL Server relational database engine in 1984, and later by Microsoft in Microsoft SQL Server, TDS packets can be encased in other physical transport dependent protocols, including TCP/IP, named pipes, and shared memory. Consequently, access to SQL Server is available over these protocols. In addition, the SQL Server API is also exposed over web services.
\subsection{Editions}
Similar to the previous version, SQL Server 2014 is available in three principal editions. All three edi-
tions have tighter alignment than their predecessors and were designed to meet the needs of almost
any customer. Each edition comes in a 32-bit and 64-bit version. The principal editions are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Enterprise edition
\item Standard edition
\item Business Intelligence edition
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Enterprise edition}
The Enterprise edition of SQL Server 2014 is the uppermost SKU and is considered the premium offer-
ing. It is designed to meet the highest demands of large-scale data centers and data warehouse solu-
tions by providing mission-critical performance and availability for tier 1 applications and the ability
to deploy private-cloud, highly virtualized environments and large, centralized, or external-facing
business-intelligence solutions.

The Enterprise edition features include the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A maximum number of cores, subject to the operating system being used
\item Unlimited virtualization
\item AlwaysOn to achieve advanced high availability
\item Unlimited virtualization for organizations with software assurance
\item Support for the new columnstore indexing feature
\item Advanced auditing
\item Transparent data encryption
\item Compression and partitioning
\end{itemize}
In addition, all the features and capabilities of the Business Intelligence edition are available, in-
cluding:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reporting
\item Analytics
\item Multidimensional BI semantic model
\item Data quality services
\item Master data services
\item In-memory tabular BI semantic model
\item Self-service business intelligence
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Standard edition}
The Standard edition is a data-management platform tailored toward departmental databases and
limited business-intelligence applications that are typically appropriate for medium-class solutions,
smaller organizations, or departmental solutions. It does not include all the bells and whistles of the
Enterprise and Business Intelligence editions, although it continues to offer best-in-class manage-
ability and ease of use. Compared with the Enterprise and Business Intelligence editions, the Standard
edition supports up to 16 cores and includes the following features:
Spatial support
\begin{itemize}
\item FileTable
\item Policy-based management
\item Corporate business intelligence
\item Reporting
\item Analytics
\item Multidimensional BI semantic model
\item AlwaysOn 2-Node failover clustering to achieve basic high availability
\item Up to four processors, up to 64 GB of RAM, one virtual machine, and two failover clustering
nodes
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Bussiness Intelligence edition}
The Business Intelligence edition offers organizations the full suite of powerful BI capabilities, such as
scalable reporting and analytics, Power View, and PowerPivot. It is tailored toward organizations that
need corporate business intelligence and self-service capabilities but do not require the full online
transactional processing (OLTP) performance and scalability found in the Enterprise edition. Here is a
high-level list of what the Business Intelligence edition includes:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Up to a maximum of 16 cores for the Database Engine
\item Maximum number of cores for business-intelligence processing
\item All of the features found in the Standard edition
\item Corporate business intelligence
\end{itemize}
%\subsubsection{Specilized editions}
Above and beyond the three principal editions of SQL Server 2014, Microsoft continues to deliver
specialized editions for organizations that have a unique set of requirements. Some examples include
the following:
%\subsubsubsection{Developer}
The Developer edition includes all the features and functionality found in the
Enterprise edition; however, it is meant strictly for the purpose of development, testing, and
demonstration. Note that you can transition a SQL Server Developer installation directly to
production (without reinstallation) by upgrading it to SQL Server 2014 Enterprise.
%\subsubsubsection{Web}
Available at a much more affordable price than the Enterprise and Standard editions,
the SQL Server 2014 Web edition is focused on service providers hosting Internet-facing web-
services environments. Unlike the Express edition, this edition doesn’t have database size re-
strictions, it supports four processors, and supports up to 64 GB of memory. SQL Server 2014
Web edition does not offer the same premium features found in the Enterprise and Standard
editions, but it still remains the ideal platform for hosting websites and web applications.
%\subsubsubsection{Express}
This free edition is the best entry-level alternative for independent software
vendors, nonprofessional developers, and hobbyists building client applications. Individuals
learning about databases or learning how to build client applications will find that this edi-
tion meets all their needs. In a nutshell, this edition is limited to one processor and 1 GB of
memory, and it can have a maximum database size of 10 GB. Also, Express is integrated with
Microsoft Visual Studio.

\section{Oracle}
An Oracle database is a collection of data treated as a unit. The purpose of a database is to store and retrieve related information. A database server is the key to solving the problems of information management. In general, a server reliably manages a large amount of data in a multiuser environment so that many users can concurrently access the same data. All this is accomplished while delivering high performance. A database server also prevents unauthorized access and provides efficient solutions for failure recovery.

Oracle Database is the first database designed for enterprise grid computing, the most flexible and cost effective way to manage information and applications. Enterprise grid computing creates large pools of industry-standard, modular storage and servers. With this architecture, each new system can be rapidly provisioned from the pool of components. There is no need for peak workloads, because capacity can be easily added or reallocated from the resource pools as needed.

The database has logical structures and physical structures. Because the physical and logical structures are separate, the physical storage of data can be managed without affecting the access to logical storage structures.
\section{Versions}
Oracle products follow a custom release numbering and naming convention. With the Oracle RDBMS 10g release, Oracle Corporation began using the "10g" label in all versions of its major products, although some sources refer to Oracle Applications Release 11i as Oracle 11i.[clarification needed] The suffixes "i", "g" and "c" do not actually represent a low-order part of the version number, as letters typically represent in software industry version numbering; that is, there is no predecessor version of Oracle 10g called Oracle 10f. Instead, the letters stand for "internet", "grid" and "cloud", respectively.[73] Consequently, many simply drop the "g" or "i" suffix when referring to specific versions of an Oracle product.

Major database-related products and some of their versions include:

Oracle Application Server 10g (also known as "Oracle AS 10g"): a middleware product;
Oracle Applications Release 11i (aka Oracle e-Business Suite, Oracle Financials or Oracle 11i): a suite of business applications;
Oracle Developer Suite 10g (9.0.4);
Oracle JDeveloper 10g: a Java integrated development environment;
Since version 2, Oracle's RDBMS release numbering has used the following codes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Oracle v2 : 2.3
\item Oracle v3 : 3.1.3
\item Oracle v4 : 4.1.4.0-4.1.4.4
\item Oracle v5 : 5.0.22, 5.1.17, 5.1.22
\item Oracle v6 : 6.0.17-6.0.36 (no OPS code), 6.0.37 (with OPS)
\item Oracle7: 7.0.12–7.3.4
\item Oracle8 Database: 8.0.3–8.0.6
\item Oracle8i Database Release 1: 8.1.5.0–8.1.5.1
\item Oracle8i Database Release 2: 8.1.6.0–8.1.6.3
\item Oracle8i Database Release 3: 8.1.7.0–8.1.7.4
\item Oracle9i Database Release 1: 9.0.1.0–9.0.1.5 (Patchset as of December 2003)
\item Oracle9i Database Release 2: 9.2.0.1–9.2.0.8 (Patchset as of April 2007)
\item Oracle Database 10g Release 1: 10.1.0.2–10.1.0.5 (Patchset as of February 2006)
\item Oracle Database 10g Release 2: 10.2.0.1–10.2.0.5 (Patchset as of April 2010)
\item Oracle Database 11g Release 1: 11.1.0.6–11.1.0.7 (Patchset as of September 2008)
\item Oracle Database 11g Release 2: 11.2.0.1–11.2.0.4 (Patchset as of August 2013)
\item Oracle Database 12c Release 1: 12.1.0.1 (Patchset as of June 2013)
\item Oracle Database 12c Release 1: 12.1.0.2 (Patchset as of July 2014).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Oracle Database Product Family}
Based on licensing and pricing, Oracle Corporation groups its Oracle Database-related product portfolio into the "Oracle Database Product Family", which consists of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Oracle Database Editions, variations of the software designed for different scenarios.
\item Database Options, extra cost offers providing additional database functionality.
\item Oracle Data Models, database schemas, offering pre-built data models with database analytics and business intelligence capabilities for specific industries.
\item Management packs, integrated set of Oracle Enterprise Manager tools for maintaining various aspects of Oracle Database.
\item Some of Oracle engineered systems, either specifically built for Oracle Database deployment or supporting such capability.
\item Other related products intended for use with Oracle Database.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Supported platforms}
Prior to releasing Oracle 9i in 2001, Oracle Corporation ported its database product to a wide variety of platforms. Subsequently Oracle Corporation consolidated on a smaller range of operating-system platforms.

Starting with Oracle Database 12.1.0.1 (released on Jun 25, 2013), the database server software is only provided for 64-bit platforms. Oracle Database 12c is supported on the following OS and architecture combinations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Linux on x86-64 (only Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux and SUSE distributions are supported)
\item Microsoft Windows on x86-64
\item Oracle Solaris on SPARC and x86-64
\item IBM AIX on POWER Systems
\item IBM Linux on z Systems
\item HP-UX on Itanium
\end{itemize}
In 2011, Oracle Corporation announced the availability of Oracle Database Appliance, a pre-built, pre-tuned, highly available clustered database server built using two SunFire X86 servers and direct attached storage.
\subsection{Physical and Logical Structures}
An Oracle database system—identified by an alphanumeric system identifier or SID—comprises at least one instance of the application, along with data storage. An instance—identified persistently by an instantiation number 
—comprises a set of operating-system processes andmemory-structures that interact with the storage. (Typical processes include PMON (the process monitor) and SMON (the system monitor)). Oracle documentation can refer to an active database instance as a "shared memory realm".

The Oracle DBMS can store and execute stored procedures and functions within itself. PL/SQL (Oracle Corporation's proprietary procedural extension to SQL), or the object-oriented language Java can invoke such code objects and/or provide the programming structures for writing them.
Storage:
The Oracle RDBMS stores data logically in the form of tablespaces and physically in the form of data files ("datafiles"). Tablespaces can contain various types ofmemory segments, such as Data Segments, Index Segments, etc. Segments in turn comprise one or more extents. Extents comprise groups of contiguous data blocks. Data blocks form the basic units of data storage.
A DBA can impose maximum quotas on storage per user within each tablespace. 
\subsection{Database Schema}
Most Oracle database installations traditionally came with a default schema called SCOTT. After the installation process sets up sample tables, the user can log into the database with the username scott and the password tiger. The name of the SCOTT schema originated with Bruce Scott, one of the first employees at Oracle (then Software Development Laboratories), who had a cat named Tiger. 
Oracle Corporation now de-emphasizes the SCOTT schema, as it uses few features of more recent Oracle releases. Most recent examples supplied by Oracle Corporation reference the default HR or OE schemas.
Other default schemas include:
\begin{itemize}
\item SYS (essential core database structures and utilities)
\item SYSTEM (additional core database structures and utilities, and privileged account)
\item OUTLN (utilized to store metadata for stored outlines for stable query-optimizer execution plans. 
\item BI, IX, HR, OE, PM, and SH (expanded sample schemas containing more data and structures than the older SCOTT schema).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Concurrency and Locking}
Oracle databases control simultaneous access to data resources with locks (alternatively documented as "enqueues").The databases also utilize "latches" - low-level serialization mechanisms to protect shared data structures in the System Global Area. 
Oracle locks fall into three categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item DML locks (or data locks) protect data
\item DDL locks (or data dictionary locks) protect the structure of schema objects
\item System locks (including latches, mutexes and internal locks) protect internal database structures like data files.
\end{itemize}
