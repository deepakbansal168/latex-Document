\section{Product Functions}
Our project current augments the following features to OpenSCAD:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Multi-threaded geometric rendering}: The process of rendering which includes traverssing and then evaluating each node in the abstract node tree is tweaked to work using multiple threads all connected to one another in a hierarchical manner mimicing the original tree. All of this is done in order to ensure that work load is divided between different processor cores in the machine.
	\item \textbf{Cancellation of the rendering process}: Once the rendering process has been started it should be cancellable from a button in the proggress widget for the rendering process.
\end{enumerate}
