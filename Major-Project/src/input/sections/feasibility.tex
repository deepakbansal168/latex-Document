a project. These are some feasibility factors by which we can used to determine that the project is feasible or not:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf{Technical feasibility}}: Technological feasibility is carried out to determine whether the project has the capability, in terms of software, hardware, personnel to handle and fulfill the user requirements. This whole project is based on Open Source Environment and is part of an open source software which would be deployed on any OS.
