\section{Future Scope}
OpenSCAD being an open source project and supported by a large open Source community have a lot of scope for future improvements and additions as other individuals can also contribute in it and add additional functionality. Being an Open Source project there is a constant flow of suggestion and demands by people. Our project is no exception to that. Much of the work that has been done in this project can be scalled to some other components as well. The majority of this project works on top of a nodal tree. And this tree can have millions of nodes at times. Obviously there is immense scope for parallelisation. Of course not everything can be done in parallel, some due to pure algorithimic reasons and others because of liminations of libraries that are being used. OpenSCAD is heavy on CPU intensive work, and as is the case with computers in general, parallelisation is the future for openSCAD as well.
