\section{Design Approach}
Object Oriented design approach has been used for this project. This statement may seem simple and succint but it captures, perfectly, all the complexities and intricacies of the whole OpenSCAD software and our project component in particular.
It was not of course a free choice for us as we had to adopt to the design principles already in place for this software. And for a project of this size the answer was always going to be object oriented design. Conventional form of objected orientation has been used in bulk throughout the code base of this software along with the usage of many design patterns. Out of these, we had to encounter with a few in our specific working component. The most notable example being that of the visitor design pattern. We had to study it and observe its usage inside of the software in order to alter it and build upon it. So we did.
